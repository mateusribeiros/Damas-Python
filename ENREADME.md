# Checkers Game with Artificial Intelligence

This project aims to develop a Checkers game where a human player can play against an artificial intelligence. The application was implemented in Python, using the Pygame library to create an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface.

## Features

The application includes the following features:

- **Start a New Game WITHOUT AI Analysis:** The player can start a new game of regular Checkers at any time.
- **Start a New Game WITH AI Analysis:** The player starts a game of Checkers where real-time analysis performed by the Artificial Intelligence through the decision tree will be shown before choosing the best move and moving the piece.
- **Save and Resume Game:** It is possible to interrupt the current game and save it to continue later from where it was left off.
- **Game Information:** The player can view important information such as the current player's turn, the number of pieces captured by each player, and which pieces are "kings."
- **Game Recording:** The sequence of moves in a game can be recorded for later playback and analysis.

## Intuitive Interface

The graphical interface was designed to be intuitive and easy to use. The player can interact with the game through mouse clicks and movements. The menus are clear and provide options such as starting a new game, saving the current game, or quitting the game.

## Artificial Intelligence

The highlight of this project is the presence of an artificial intelligence that plays as the opponent to the human player. The AI has been developed to choose the best possible move at each moment, seeking to maximize its chances of winning. It uses a search strategy with a decision depth of 2, enabling smarter and more strategic decision-making.

## Contributors

This project was developed in collaboration by ![Isabela de Queiroz](https://github.com/isabela-code), Mateus Ribeiro, and ![Fabr√≠cio Silva](https://github.com/FafizDev). Each member contributed their skills and knowledge to make this Checkers game with artificial intelligence a reality.

## How to Run the Game

To run the game, you need to have Python installed along with the Pygame library. After installation, simply run the main game file, and the graphical interface will open, allowing the human player to start playing against the artificial intelligence.

## Final Remarks

This project combines fun and challenge by bringing a Checkers game with an artificial intelligence as an opponent. The user-friendly graphical interface, comprehensive features, and intelligent strategy of the AI provide an engaging gaming experience. Enjoy playing Checkers against the computer!
